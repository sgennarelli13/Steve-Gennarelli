I'm a driven individual with the ability to adapt and thrive in challenging environments. Eager to pursue a career in cybersecurity and apply the wide array of skills learned from 10+ years in kitchen and business management.

## Objective

I originally became interested in cybersecurity during the summer of 2022 while quarantined due to Covid. After almost a decade in the restaurant industry, I knew I wanted to pivot into a tech based career, but my real journey began when I started researching cybersecurity. 
The more I read up on subjects like risk management, vulnerability scanning, and network hardening, the more fascinated I became. This led me to enroll in Flatiron Schoolâ€™s Cybersecurity Engineering Program, which I completed in February 2024 and now I am currently seeking a role as a:

-Cybersecurity Engineer

-Cybersecurity Analyst

-Security Risk and Compliance Engineer

-Risk Management Analyst
